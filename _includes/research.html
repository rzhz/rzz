        Virtual brands, established by firms beyond their original brands to sell their existing products on online platforms, 
        are gaining prominence on various food-delivery platforms. This paper studies a firm's decision to create multiple 
        brands on an online platform and the platform's decision to recommend them to consumers who make their purchase 
        decisions after searching recommended brands on the platform. We find a multi-product firm can utilize multiple 
        identical-menu brands with different leading products to communicate information about its product variety, 
        enticing more consumers to search its brands on the platform. Surprisingly, such information transmission by a 
        multi-product firm raises not only consumer surplus but also the profit of the single-product firm that does not 
        utilize virtual brands. We find that under privacy environment where the platform does not have access to 
        consumer-preference information, it facilitates this information transmission by consistently recommending all brands 
        to all consumers. By contrast, under no privacy where the platform knows consumer types, it uses brands with different
        leading products to target different consumer segments, which essentially restricts the information-transmission channel.
        Interestingly, however, the profits of both the platform and the virtual-brand-offering firm increase as a result.
        Finally, we show banning identical-menu virtual brands can further benefit both the multi-product firm and consumers
        when the ban pushes the multi-product firm to create multiple virtual brands specializing in distinct products. However,
        when the ban leads the multi-product firm to keep only one brand with all its products, the ban can hurt consumers and 
        all firm types.

        We examine  the implications of privacy-motivated targeting restrictions on consumer welfare, advertisers' customer 
        acquisition costs, and platform revenue. In our model,  competitive product firms reach consumers by placing informative
        ads on a monopoly advertising platform; consumers are horizontally differentiated in their product preferences and in 
        their willingness to pay for a non-preferred product, but they don't have any intrinsic privacy preferences, nor an aversion
        to advertising <em>per se</em>. <br />
        <br />
        In this context we show that both platform and consumers would be better off without any privacy restrictions if ad rates 
        were exogenous to the privacy regime. However, in the more realistic scenario of endogenous ad rates, consumers with 
        flexible product preferences are likely to be better off under privacy. We argue that a platform with market power selling 
        informative ads to competitive product firms will recognize the threat to ad volume posed by cross-selling through mistargeted 
        ads. To compensate, the platform will lower ad rates, which will then be passed on to consumers in the form of lower product prices.

        Firms selling products to consumers realize that it takes time to learn consumers' preferences 
        (say, by tracking their online behavior). What makes it even more challenging is that consumers' 
        preferences may change over time, depreciating the value of acquired information. How should the 
        firm personalize its offers and change them dynamically to learn as well as adapt to changing tastes?
        How should consumers behave in light of these dynamic offers? I build a continuous-time bargaining
        model with one-sided incomplete information where a buyer's binary type is publicly revealed through
        Brownian motion and the binary type changes via a Poisson process. In equilibrium, firms will start
        with high prices which will only be accepted by high-type consumers with positive probability and 
        as belief drifts below a certain threshold, the firm will offer the lowest price that will be 
        accepted by both types immediately. Changing tastes have two effects: a level effect that leaves 
        low value consumers less likely to accept a given offer and a slope effect so that the firm screens 
        high value consumers faster. Hence type change benefits both types of consumers at a cost to the firm. 
        If the firm is restricted to constant prices and can use the acquired information to select consumers, 
        it is better off than under dynamic prices. The continuation bargaining process gets resolved slower 
        under fixed prices than under flexible prices, which makes consumers more willing to accept a given offer quicker.

        This paper investigates the effect of a tailored news report and its targeted release by an ideologically
        biased firm. Targeted media strategies include selective information disclosure and audience targeting,
        with audience targeting being a novel method of distorting information to voters. When the media firm
        cannot commit to either strategy, targeted media provides are less biased than traditional media. With
        full commitment in both strategies, however, targeted media do not necessarily generate more bias
        because selective audience targeting may be more effective in channeling the bias.

                Impact of Marketing Employee Turnover on Brand Health Metrics

        Marketing employee turnover poses a critical challenge for firms seeking to sustain brand performance, 
        yet its impact remains under-explored. This study is the first one to examine empirically the impact of
        marketing employees' exits on brand health metrics, highlighting the critical role of hierarchical and 
        functional positions in shaping brand performance. By merging employee data from Revelio Labs (departures 
        and job descriptions) with brand metrics from YouGov, we assemble a large-scale archival dataset comprising 
        23,715 brand-quarter observations for 765 brands from 2012 to 2020. Our empirical evidence supports the
        idea that senior executive, middle managers and junior employee exits play an important role in brand 
        performance. First, we find that the exits of marketing employees negatively affect brand buzz and brand 
        equity with an increasing magnitude across the hierarchical levels. Senior marketing executives have the 
        most pronounced effect on brand buzz and equity (-0.024, and -0.017), followed by middle managers (-0.0061, 
        and -0.0046) and then junior employees (-0.0028 and non-significant effect on brand equity). We note that 
        (1) most of these effects are also sustained for four quarters (2) the effects on brand buzz are larger 
        than those on brand equity across the board and that (3) junior employee exits are not impactful for brand
        equity. We also find that digital marketing employees (e.g., those in social media or platform roles) drive
        most of the observed effects. For instance, senior digital marketing executive exits have a substantially 
        larger negative impact on brand buzz and brand equity (-0.082 and -0.066) compared to their non-digital 
        counterparts (-0.0095 and -0.0014). Robustness checks---including the use of peers-of-peers marketing 
        employee exits as instrumental variables---confirm our main findings.
