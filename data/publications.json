      "abstract": "Virtual brands, established by firms beyond their original brands to sell their existing products on online platforms, 
                    are gaining prominence on various food-delivery platforms. This paper studies a firm's decision to create multiple 
                    brands on an online platform and the platform's decision to recommend them to consumers who make their purchase 
                    decisions after searching recommended brands on the platform. We find a multi-product firm can utilize multiple 
                    identical-menu brands with different leading products to communicate information about its product variety, 
                    enticing more consumers to search its brands on the platform. Surprisingly, such information transmission by a 
                    multi-product firm raises not only consumer surplus but also the profit of the single-product firm that does not 
                    utilize virtual brands. We find that under privacy environment where the platform does not have access to 
                    consumer-preference information, it facilitates this information transmission by consistently recommending all brands 
                    to all consumers. By contrast, under no privacy where the platform knows consumer types, it uses brands with different
                    leading products to target different consumer segments, which essentially restricts the information-transmission channel.
                    Interestingly, however, the profits of both the platform and the virtual-brand-offering firm increase as a result.
                    Finally, we show banning identical-menu virtual brands can further benefit both the multi-product firm and consumers
                    when the ban pushes the multi-product firm to create multiple virtual brands specializing in distinct products. However,
                    when the ban leads the multi-product firm to keep only one brand with all its products, the ban can hurt consumers and 
                    all firm types.",
